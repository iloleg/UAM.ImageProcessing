# Image processing application
This application was created as a part of image processing course. It can load/save images in .pnm format family and run filters on them:

* Custom convolution matrix
* Histogram
  * Stretch
  * Equalize
* Blur
  * Uniform
  * Gaussian
* Edge detection
  * Laplace
  * Gradient
  * Sobel
  * Prewitt
  * Roberts
  * Laplacian of Gaussian
  * Difference of Gaussian
  * Crossing of zero
  * Canny
* Median denoise
* Morphology
  * Dilation
  * Erosion
  * Closing
  * Opening
* Thresholding
  * Plain
  * Otsu
  * Triangle
  * Entropy
  * Niblack
* Artistic
  * Oil
  * Fisheye
  * Mirror
  * Negative
  * Emboss
* Normal mapping
* Horizon mapping
* Hough line detection
* Harris corner detection
* Hough rectangle detection
* Distance transform
* Greyscale

In addition there are few tools: histogram view; brightness, gamma and contrast correction.
